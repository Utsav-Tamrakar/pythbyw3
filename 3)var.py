#Variables are containers for storing data values.Python has no command for declaring variables.
#
x=5 #assign value and it is an integer
y="Hello" #assign and it is string
print(type(x)) # this will show the type of a variables
print(type(y))

#Variable casting 
x=str(3)
y=int(3)
z=float(3)
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
# x="john" and x='john'both are same in python language
# case sensitive
a=4 
A=6
print(a)
print(A)
#Legal variable names:myvar = "John"
#my_var = "John"
#_my_var = "John"
#myVar = "John"
#MYVAR = "John"
#myvar2 = "John" and some illegal names : 2myvarand so on

#to assign multiple variables
x,y,z="Orange","Banana","Cherry"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

#ways to print output var
